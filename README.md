## Project Topic: Global electronics retailer Analysis

### Project Overview 
Creating a sales performance dashboard for a global electronics retailer to consolidate and analyze sales, customer, product, and store data. The dashboard tracks key performance metrics, uncover sales trends, and provide actionable insights for management to make data-driven decisions.

### Business Problem 
Revenue has been on a downward trend since 2020, and the management lacked a unified view of performance across sales channels, regions, and customer demographics. Without an interactive dashboard, it'd have been difficult to identify top performing products, regions, and customer segments, or to understand areas of declining performance. The management thus needed a consolidated data model and an interactive report to explore key sales drivers, monitor revenue and profit trends, and evaluate store and product-level performance.

### Data Model Overview: 
The dataset consists of multiple related tables:

- **Sales:** Contains transactional data including orders, delivery dates, quantities, currency, and links to customers, stores, and products.
- **Customers :** Provides customer demographics (gender, age, location) to analyze customer behavior and segmentation.
- **Products:** Includes product details (brand, color, subcategory, category, unit cost, and unit price) for product performance and profitability analysis.
- **Stores:** Provides store-level details (location, size, and open date) to assess regional and store performance.
- **Exchange Rates (Supporting Table):** Provides conversion rates by date and currency to ensure consistent reporting in USD.

### Components of SALES DASHBOARD

 - **Overall Performance (KPI Tracking)**

     - Total revenue, profit, quantity sold, and customer count.
     - Are these KPIs growing or declining compared to targets?
 
 - **Trends Over Time (Monthly Analysis)**
  
     - How revenue, profit, quantity, and customer count have changed month by month since 2020.
     - Are there seasonal patterns or months where performance consistently drops?
  
 4. Year-over-Year (YoY) Comparison
 How does performance in the current year compare to previous years?
 What is the YoY growth/decline % for revenue, profit, and customers?
 Are we recovering or still trending downward?

 5. Product Performance
 Which products, categories, and subcategories are driving revenue and profit
 growth?
 Which ones are underperforming and contributing to the decline?
 What are the top 10 best-sellers vs. the bottom 10 laggards?
 Are our profit margins shrinking due to rising costs or discounting?
 6. Customer Insights
 Who are our customers? (gender, age, geography)
 Are we losing existing customers or failing to attract new ones?
 Which customer segments contribute the most to revenue and profit?
 Are younger or older demographics shifting their buying behavior?

 7. Store & Regional Performance
 Which stores, states, and countries are performing well vs. declining?
 Are certain regions driving the overall revenue decline?
 How does store performance vary based on open date (new vs. old stores)
